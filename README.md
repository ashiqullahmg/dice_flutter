# dice_flutter

A new Flutter application.

## A Flutter Dice Game
This is a simple dice game in Flutter. I have modified it with winning, loosing and other functionalities. App launches, player 1 can start the dice rolling first, you may change it to player 2 as well. Each player gets only 10 turns. After completing their turns, the the app decides the winner. Although I could, I haven't used functions here as this is my second application in flutter.

## Future Work
  1. Use functions
  2. Add animations
  3. Make it computerized (playing with robot)
  4. A new look

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
